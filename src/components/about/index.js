      <p className='text-lg md:text-2xl mb-8 text-justify'>I am currently a <span>Front-end Developer</span> at IBM Design working on IBM's open source design system, <a href="http://carbondesignsystem.com/">Carbon Design System</a>. I am collaborate with other developers and designers to make a design language and component library that we are proud of. Although I fell into the design system world accidently, it turned out to be the happiest accident. I met the most incredible team. I learned and grew so much. But I think the most important think I found while working on Carbon was empathy for others but especially other developers. And writing code with others in mind.</p>
      <p className='text-lg md:text-2xl mb-8 text-justify'>Outside of IBM, I have started collaborating and working in communities in the NFT space that I am interested in. I've helped build out websites for the communities that I am a part of. My favorite part of web development is the css challenges that come with it. The simple aspect of collaborating is so important to me because thats where you grow the most.</p>
      <p className='text-lg md:text-2xl mb-8 text-justify'>On the other side of my life are my pups Aristotle and Cooper and my obsession for them. I love movies. I love trying new restaurants and exploring the fun little things Austin has to offer.</p>
