      <p className='text-lg mb-8 text-justify'>Who am I you may ask? It all started when I was watching the show Silicon Valley. While studying for the LSAT, I became intrigued to learn more about the world of software engineering. Truthfully I had no idea what any of it entailed. It opened my eyes to a whole new world, and when I found CSS and frontend I fell in love with the idea that I could create something visual with just lines of code. Yes I do love CSS incase you were wondering.</p>
      <p className='text-lg mb-8 text-justify'>I am currently a <span>Frontend Developer</span> at IBM Design working on IBM's open source design system, <a href="http://carbondesignsystem.com/">Carbon Design System</a>. I am collaborate with other developers and designers to make a design language and component library that we are proud of. Although I fell into the design system world accidently, it turned out to be the happiest accident. I met the most incredible team. I learned and grew so much. But I think the most important think I found while working on Carbon was empathy for others but especially other developers. And writing code with others in mind.</p>
      <p className='text-lg mb-8 text-justify'>On the other side of my life are my pups Aristotle and Cooper and my obsession for them. I love movies. I love knowing random facts and telling others about them. I love trying new restaurants and exploring the fun little things Austin has to offer.</p>
